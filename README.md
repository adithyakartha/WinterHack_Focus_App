Abstract

ADHD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is one of the if not the most common neurodevelopmental disorder that exists today. This disorder usually stems all the way from childhood until adulthood, so it is something that millions of people face. To put it into perspective, India alone has over 10 million cases of ADHD every year. 

ADHD unlike other disorders have several symptoms, and almost everyone here, even if they aren't diagnosed with ADHD tend to have some of its symptoms such as 
Inability to stay organised
Restlessness
Forgetfulness
Lack of focus, etc

Most of us suffer from one or a few of these symptoms. We at FOCUS provide a platform for everyone suffering from ADHD or any of the symptoms. 

At focus we prioritise understanding our users on a deeper level, to ensure that the services that we provide will be extremely beneficial for them and their fight to conquer ADHD. As the first step we conduct a short survey consisting of short mcqs to grasp our users' needs. (for example someone who cannot organise themselves may not suffer from a lack of focus). Based on the answers we present the results to the user and also recommend some of the services that we provide at FOCUS. 

Our base product consists of 3 main features:
Task manager. Similar to most task management systems out there, options to name, set duration, colour code, start time and end time are all present in most task management systems. However several studies show that even today smartphone apps have failed to show superiority over paper-based lists regarding the proportion of daily tasks completed, we bring you 3 features to change that: 
REWARDS: However at focus we have implemented a reward/point based system. Here users can complete tasks to earn points and rewards. This encourages users to complete their tasks and also lets them keep track of their progress to beat ADHD using the point based system
SUBTASKS: Most tasks are left incomplete due to its difficulty and the fact that it just seems impossible right?. We give users the option to break down these “impossible” tasks into several smaller subtasks so that they can be more motivated to complete the final task at hand. And who wouldn't like finishing tasks and getting rewards for it.
PRIORITY: An option to prioritise tasks based on importance is an option as well.
